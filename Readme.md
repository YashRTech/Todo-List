## 📚 What I Learned

This was my first complex JavaScript project built completely on my own. Here's what I gained:

- ✨ Mastered modular JS structure and Webpack bundling
- 🧠 Deep understanding of DOM manipulation, event delegation, and project architecture
- 🧪 Spent over 5 days debugging — improved my problem-solving and code clarity
- 💡 Took help from AI for conceptual hints (like how to edit), but wrote and implemented all logic myself
- 🎨 UI inspiration from external references, but fully customized and integrated
- 📱 Understood responsive design better with toggle menus and mobile-first styling
- 💪 Built stronger confidence in JavaScript — this project pushed me hard, but now I feel levels ahead of where I was 10 days ago!
